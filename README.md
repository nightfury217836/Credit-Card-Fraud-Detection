# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning | End-to-End Resume Project with Python

Learn how to build a Credit Card Fraud Detection System using Machine Learning and Data Science in Python! 🚀

In this step-by-step project, we’ll use real-world credit card transaction data to detect fraudulent activities using various ML algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

This project is perfect for data science and machine learning beginners looking to build a real-world, resume-worthy project that demonstrates practical skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

🧠 What You’ll Learn:

Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques

Handling imbalanced datasets (SMOTE, undersampling, oversampling)

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization

Model building and performance evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC Curve)

Deploying a fraud detection model

🧩 Tools & Libraries Used:

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
